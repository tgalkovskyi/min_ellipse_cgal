# min_ellipse_cgal

This is an implementation of the more general approach to compute the smallest enclosing ellipse of a set of points for the 2D case. The approach is described in a peer reviewed article [The Domination Heuristic for LP-type Problems](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611972894.8)

Implementation is supposed to work with CGAL 3.3, but was not tested on newer versions of the framework.
